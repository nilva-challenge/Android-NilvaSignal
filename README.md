# In name of Allah

## Introduction
We want you to add a feature to [signal app messanger](https://github.com/signalapp). We need you to add bluetooth messanging with signal current chat structure & design (meaning you must follow its patterns for sending & receiving chat messages). So app is consisted of two parts:
1. **finding pair:** finding fellow signal users with bluetooth & starting a chat with them.
2. **chat:** the two connected signal users should be able to chat via bluetooth as they would normally.

### note
You must design a new page with custom layout for finding pair via bluetooth.


## Expectations

So What does matter to us?
- ability to understand other people's code
- you must be able to explain the flow of sending & receiving messages in signal app
- ability to learn

## Tasks

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone signal's codebase
4. Understand codebase & structure
5. Develop the specified feature
6. Explain how chat messages are handled in readme
6. Send us a pull request, we will review and get back to you
7. Enjoy

**Finally** don't be afraid to ask anything from us.
